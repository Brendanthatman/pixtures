        <h2>About Pixtures</h2>
        <p>Pixtures is a photo sharing website for photographers, beginning and advanced. Pixtures prides itself being a platform where users can openly share their photos without judgement, and others can view photos from photographers for free. Pixtures is reviewed by a team of real people, ensuring that photos aren't AI generated, appropriate, and appropriate for online use. We also allow onlookers to send messages to photographers for the chance to use their photos outside of the website.</p>
        <p>Pixtures was crafted with care, by a photographer, for other photographers. Come on in, stop by the website once or keep on coming back for more. We thank you sincerely for your contributions and viewing of our platform.</p>
